/**
 * Build the json-formula evaluation context from a crJSON report.
 *
 * The Python reference evaluator expects `validationResults` to live at
 * `manifests[i].validationResults` (so expressions like
 * `manifests[0].validationResults.failure[?...]` work). c2pa-rs sometimes
 * emits it at the document root instead; we normalize by mirroring the
 * root-level validation into `manifests[0]` if it isn't already present.
 *
 * Otherwise the context is pass-through: our crJSON already has
 * `manifest.assertions` as a label-keyed object and `manifest['claim.v2']`
 * as a dotted key, which is exactly what the rubric expressions assume.
