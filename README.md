# C2PA Conformance Testing Tool

A web application for validating C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) manifests in media files. This tool provides an easy-to-use interface for drag-and-drop file testing with detailed conformance reports.

**Built with the official [@contentauth/c2pa-web](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js) SDK** - ensuring complete file format support and validation compatibility.

## Features

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Easy file upload via drag-and-drop or file selection
- **Client-Side Processing**: Uses the official C2PA SDK compiled to WebAssembly for fast, private processing
- **Official C2PA Trust List**: Validates signatures against the official [C2PA Conformance Trust List](https://c2pa.org/conformance)
- **Interim Trust List (ITL)**: Automatically detects and validates signatures against the ITL with distinct visual indicators
- **Test Certificate Mode**: Enable test mode to load the C2PA Conformance Test Root, download the test signing cert (ZIP), and add custom test certificates (session-only, clearly marked)
- **Version Tracking**: Every report includes git commit SHA and date for reproducibility ([details](VERSION_TRACKING.md))
- **Modern Tailwind CSS UI**: Clean, responsive design matching verify.contentauthenticity.org
- **Comprehensive Reports**: View detailed C2PA manifest information including:
  - Manifest summary (claim generator, trust status)
  - Signature information with trust validation
  - Active manifest details
  - Assertions and claims
  - Ingredient information
  - Validation status with clear test/production indicators
- **crJSON Reports**: Reports use the Content Credentials JSON (crJSON) format from the C2PA SDK, with syntax-highlighted raw JSON
- **Multiple Output Options**:
  - Human-readable formatted view
  - Raw JSON display (syntax highlighted)
  - Downloadable JSON reports (with version metadata)
  - Copy to clipboard functionality

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)

### Installing Prerequisites

#### Install Node.js
Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies, including the official `@contentauth/c2pa-web` package. The postinstall script automatically copies the WASM binary to the `public/` directory.

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite's development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

1. **Build the web application**:
```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` directory.

2. **Preview the production build**:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

Merging a pull request to `main` automatically triggers a Netlify build and deploys to production. No manual steps required.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for details on the build process and preview deployments.

## Usage

### Basic Validation

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Drag and drop a media file anywhere, or click "Browse Files"
3. The tool will process the file and display:
   - Signature information with trust validation
   - Active C2PA manifest information
   - Assertions and claims
   - Ingredient details
   - Validation status
4. Use the buttons to:
   - Toggle between formatted and raw JSON views
   - Download the report as a JSON file
   - Copy the JSON to clipboard
   - Upload another file

### Conformance Testing with Test Certificates

1. In the **Test Certificates** section, click **"Enable Test Mode"** to load the C2PA Conformance Test Root
2. Optionally click **"Download Signing Cert (ZIP)"** to get the test signing certificate bundle
3. Optionally click **"Add Custom Certificate"** to upload additional test certificates (.pem, .crt, .cer)
4. Upload a C2PA file — it will validate against the official trust list plus any test certificates
5. Reports show a clear **⚠️ Test Certificate Mode Active** warning when test certs are used
6. Test certificates are **session-only** (cleared on refresh). See [TEST_CERTIFICATES.md](TEST_CERTIFICATES.md) for details

## Supported File Types

The tool supports any file format that can contain C2PA manifests:
- Images (JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
- Videos (MP4, MOV, etc.)
- Audio files
- PDF documents

## How It Works

1. **File Upload**: User uploads a file via drag-and-drop or file picker
2. **WASM Processing**: The file is processed entirely in the browser using the official `@contentauth/c2pa-web` library
3. **Trust Validation**: Signatures are validated against the official C2PA trust lists:
   - **C2PA-TRUST-LIST.pem** - Approved signing certificates for conformant products
   - **C2PA-TSA-TRUST-LIST.pem** - Trusted Time Stamp Authorities
4. **Report Generation**: C2PA manifest data is extracted, validated, and formatted
5. **Display**: Results are shown in both human-readable and JSON formats with trust status

## Trust Verification & Conformance

This tool uses the **official C2PA Conformance Trust List** to validate digital signatures:

- ✅ Only signatures from [C2PA conformant products](https://c2pa.org/conformance) are marked as trusted
- ✅ Certificates are validated against official trust anchors maintained by C2PA
- ✅ Time stamps are verified against approved Time Stamp Authorities
- ✅ Trust lists are fetched directly from the [official C2PA repository](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/tree/main/trust-list)

**Important**: As of January 2026, the Interim Trust List (ITL) has been frozen. This tool uses the current official trust list, ensuring compatibility with conformant implementations.

## Privacy & Security

- **Client-Side Only**: All file processing happens in your browser
- **No Server Upload**: Files never leave your machine
- **No Data Collection**: No tracking or analytics
- **Trust List Updates**: Trust lists are fetched directly from the official C2PA repository when processing files

## Troubleshooting

### Module not found errors
If you see module import errors, try reinstalling dependencies:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### WASM initialization errors
Clear your browser cache and reload the page. The WASM module is loaded from the `@contentauth/c2pa-web` package automatically.

## Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run check` - Run Svelte type checking
- `npm run build:local-wasm` - Build C2PA WASM from a local `../c2pa-rs` checkout into `public/local-c2pa/` (see [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md))
- `npm run copy:profile-evaluator` - Copy profile-evaluator WASM from a sibling `../profile-evaluator-rs/ui/pkg` into `public/profile-evaluator/` so Asset Profiles evaluation works locally

## Dependencies

### Frontend
- **Svelte** (v5) - Reactive UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **@contentauth/c2pa-web** - Official C2PA JavaScript/WASM SDK from Content Authenticity Initiative
- **highlight.js** - Syntax highlighting for raw JSON in reports
- **@peculiar/x509** - Certificate parsing (e.g. in CertificateManager)
